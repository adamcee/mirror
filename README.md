# Mirror

Use a browser window as a live-preview of a markdown file, i.e. "mirror it. The imagined use-case is I'm editing a markdown file in, say, vim, but want to see a preview of what it looks like. Mirror will run a small node.js server with a websocket connection to the browser client, and update the doc in the browser dynamically as I edit and save the markdown document in my text editor.

Basically live-reloading.

This is a project created both for my own learning and as a tool I might use.
